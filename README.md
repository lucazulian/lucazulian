### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I've been programming for over half my life, I'm comfortable creating, developing, maintaining, and improving software written in C, C#, Python, Elixir, Rust, etc.
  * Most of my recent projects have been written in Elixir.
* I believe in the value of Open Source software, and run Linux upon all the systems I use.
* My current interests revolve around compilers, interpreters, domain-specific languages, and virtual machines.
