### 👋 Ciao!

I'm Luca Zulian, a Senior Software Developer with over 10 years of experience building scalable, reliable web applications. I specialise in Elixir, Phoenix, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript, working across the full stack to deliver clean, maintainable solutions.
I'm passionate about functional programming, distributed systems, machine learning and exploring the foundations of computation through compilers, type theory, and formal methods.


### 💼 Technical Focus

**Current Stack:** Elixir, Phoenix, PostgreSQL, TypeScript

**Also Experienced With:** C, C#, Python, Haskell

**Exploring:** Haskell, Rust, Erlang, OCaml, Racket, Agda, Elm


### 🔬 What Excites Me

- Programming Language Theory & Implementation
- Distributed Systems & Concurrency
- Formal Methods & Theorem Proving
- Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- Cryptography & Security
- Functional Programming Paradigms
- AI and Machine Learning


### 🌱 Currently Learning

Cryptography, Racket, and diving deeper into AI/ML fundamentals


### 🌍 Beyond Code

Based in Italy, I'm active in tech communities and meetups. When I'm not programming, you'll find me:
- Reading (philosophy, history, tech)
- Outdoors (walking, running, climbing, sailing)
- In the kitchen (making fresh pasta or baking bread)
- Practising meditation and yoga
