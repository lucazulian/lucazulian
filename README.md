### :wave: Ciao!

Hi, I'm Luca Zulian, a Senior Software Developer with over 10 years of experience building scalable, reliable web applications.
I specialise in Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres, TypeScript and I enjoy working across the full stack to deliver clean, maintainable code. I’ve got a solid grasp of the software development lifecycle, with a strong focus on product delivery, testing and writing code that lasts.
Outside of work, I like getting involved in tech communities and meetups — always learning, sharing and staying curious.

### :billed_cap: More about myself

- :earth_africa: I'm a software developer living in Italy
- :computer: I've been programming for over half my life. I'm comfortable creating, developing, maintaining, and improving software written in C, C#, Python, and Elixir (most of my recent projects have been written in Elixir), but I'd like to work more on Haskell, Rust, Erlang, OCaml, Scheme, Agda and Elm
- :speaking_head: My current interests revolve around functional programming, algorithms, compilers, interpreters, domain-specific languages, virtual machines and autonomous robot

### :raised_hands: What I'm (currently) excited about

- Programming Languages & PLT
- Distributed Systems
- Robotics
- Functional Programming
- Formal Methods
- Theorem Provers / Proof Assistants
- Cryptography
- AI

### :brain: Interests

- Life, Programming, History, Meditation, Continuous Self-Improvement, Yoga, Philosophy, Sports, Music

### :seedling: I’m currently learning:

- Cryptography, Racket and AI

### :video_game: When I am NOT at writing code, I enjoy to

- Read books :books:
- Walking :walking:, running :running:, climbing :climbing: or sailing :sailboat:
- Make fresh pasta :spaghetti: or bread :bread:
