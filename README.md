### :wave: Ciao!

Hi, My name is Luca Zulian and I am a Senior Software Engineer with a more than a decade of experience in building scalable and robust applications.
Specializing in Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres and Typescript, I bring a complete set of skills to drive innovation and excellence within full stack web development with a strong software development life cycle knowledge with a keen eye for product delivery and testing.
I enjoy participating in tech communities and meetups.
