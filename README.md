### Ciao! 👋

* I'm a software developer living in Milan, born and raised in Treviso (Italy 🇮🇹).
* I've been programming for over half my life, I'm comfortable creating, developing, maintaining, and improving software written in C, C#, Python, Elixir, Rust, etc (most of my recent projects have been written in Elixir).
* I believe in the value of Open Source software, and run Linux upon all the systems I use.
* My current interests revolve around functional programming, algorithms, compilers, interpreters, domain-specific languages and virtual machines.
